# How to generate a new board definition

1. Edit 'boards.yaml' definition file.

Make sure to give your new board a unique 'name'. Add a 'type',
'worker' name and its 'serial number'. Optionally, you can also
define 'tags'.

2. Generate device template file.

    $ python3 make-board-files.py -b boards.yaml -d devices

3. Commit.

Check for git changes in 'devices' and commit if needed.


# How to add a new board

Once LAVA has a suitable template to use new device-types and/or devices,
you can add them to the database.

    $ python3 board-setup-helper.py -b boards.yaml -H <LAVA_HOST> -u <LAVA_USER> -t <LAVA_TOKEN>
